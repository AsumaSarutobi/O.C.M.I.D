# O.C.M.I.D
O.C.M.I.D - An acronym for On Click Multiple Image Downloader

Basically a python script which can download multiple images in a single request through an url repository text file separately storing the urls of all the images which needs to be downloaded.

Conventionally for downloading an image from a site we have to first choose the image and then right click on the image and save it on hard drive. We have other applications too that can do the exact same thing of downloading the image on the disk. But they have disadvantages like:

|Expensive.|

|Ocuppy large chunk of memory and processing speed.|

|Can throw http/https errors.|

|Cannot download more than one image at a time.|

#With O.C.M.I.D you can have following advantages:
